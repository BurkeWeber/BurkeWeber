# About Me

Hello! My name is Burke Weber and I am a Senior in Aerospace Engineering. I am pursuing a minor in Nondestructive Evaluation as well.

My greatest current interest would have to be automotive aerodynamics. I love learning about cars and how they work,
especially the ones that race competiitively.

Right now I am working on expanding my engineering skills including learning new softwares and coding languages.

My favorite hobby would have to be fishing, and second to that would be a number of other outdoor activities. I love being outdoors and experiencing nature.
